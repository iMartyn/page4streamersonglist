# page4streamersonglist

A cloudflare-pages-enabled repo for setting up an image overlay based on tags on streamersonglist.

This doesn't and won't ever replace the overlay functionality within streamersonglist, it just allows you to have another overlay that's based on tags.

For instance you might want an image to appear on your stream for your originals.

You probably don't need this repo, as it deploys to https://page4streamersonglist.pages.dev/ and you can put your images somewhere else, even.
